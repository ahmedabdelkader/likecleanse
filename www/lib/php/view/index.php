	<p class="lead">We all have liked things in the past... maybe too many things to remember. Now those very things are being used to advertise to your friends! I created this tool in efforts to reducing wall clutter that we might not have known we had. Click the button bellow to login, view the items that might be un-worthy of your 'liking' and then simply 'un-like' them.</p>
